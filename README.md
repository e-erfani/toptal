Ehsan is a skilled scientist with a Ph.D. in Science and with extensive experience in cross-team working and cross-functional
team leadership to design, develop, and validate complex data science projects and codes in a timely manner. He is proficient
in Statistical techniques such as probability, regression, correlation, statistical significance, and machine learning models
(linear and logistic regressions, random forest, KNN, Na√Øve Bayes).

As an example, he involved in teamwork that improved the prediction of mathematical models of flash floods by 30% and reduced
the cost of structural damage by 10%. He managed a group of 5 to 10 scientists and researchers to design and perform an
ensemble method to analyze numerous predictive mathematical models using Big Data and increase output result accuracy. 

The novel outcomes of his projects have been published in 17 peer-reviewed and technical articles and presented in 9 scientific
lectures and 20 poster presentations at the most influential venues and conferences, and he met with senior thought leaders in
industries to discuss possible solutions for challenging problems.

Toward his community services, he was an invited judge to evaluate and provide advice to student presentations at the
scientific conferences and was an invited reviewer of more than 10 scientific manuscripts for peer-reviewed publications.

With a diverse background, he is proficient at learning new skills rapidly in order to convey unique solutions to the most
challenging problems in the industry.
